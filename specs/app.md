# nannou app

This tracker prototype is based on [nannou](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou) creative coding framework and [dsp-chain](https://github.com/RustAudio/dsp-chain). nannou uses daggy for geometric graphs, dsp-chain uses daggy for audio graphs.

## TODO

- [x] Get conrod graph working
- [ ] Implement app spec
